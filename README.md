## Personal Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! Here you will find an overview of my skills, experiences, and projects. The website is designed to showcase my abilities as a web developer and provide a platform for potential clients or employers to view my work and get in touch with me.

# Features

A dynamic and responsive layout built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A detailed about section that highlights my education, skills, and experiences
A portfolio section displaying some of my selected projects with descriptions, images, and links to live demos
A blog section where I write about my experiences, thoughts, and learning in the web development field
A contact page built with PHP that allows for easy communication and inquiries
# How to run the website locally

Clone the repository to your local machine and place it in the root directory of a web server like Apache or Nginx. Ensure that the web server has PHP installed and enabled.

The website should be available at http://localhost/ in your web browser. Note: The PHP contact page will only work if you have a working email server setup on your local machine or if you use a third-party service to handle sending emails.

# Contact

Feel free to use the contact page on the website to get in touch with me or reach out via the provided email and social media links. I would be happy to answer any questions or discuss potential projects.
